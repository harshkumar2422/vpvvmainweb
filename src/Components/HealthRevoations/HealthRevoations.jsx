              <p>
                Advanced and Intelligent algorithms would analyze medical images
                with greater accuracy than human specialists, detecting subtle
                patterns invisible to the naked eye. Use of advanced algorithms
                would facilitate early detection of dreaded diseases like cancer
                through thermal imaging, making screening more accessible and
                comfortable.
